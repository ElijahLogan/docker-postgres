adding iles into the entrypoint for docker
    the file has to be nested in a folder for it to be picked up and read. 
    Formatting is important in the file, it can be read and not be created because of errors
    formatting is different for mysql annd postgres 
    check the log of the postgres container to see whats in the database 


    Sometime I'll get the error 
Unable to connect to PostgreSQL server: could not connect to server: Connection refused Is the server running on host "pdb" (192.168.32.2) and accepting TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
or 
psql: error: connection to server on socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432" failed: No such file or directordpy
        Is the server running locally and accepting connections on that socket


to solve run
    killall Docker && open /Applications/Docker.app
    | docker volume prune |  after | docker-compose down | then  | brew services stop postgresql |

tp really solve 
killall Docker && open /Applications/Docker.app


docker has to be closed then restarted for when it gets the aforementioined error 


check process on port 
    lsof -i :5432
    kill -9 <PID>

    

sql: error: connection to server on socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432" failed: No such file or directory
        Is the server running locally and accepting connections on that socket



 ps auxw | grep post 


 The command "ps auxw | grep post" will list all the processes running on your system that contain the string "post" in their name. 
 This can be useful for finding out if the PostgreSQL server is running or not.

 what is auxw

The command "ps auxw" is a Linux command used to display information about the currently running processes on the system. It stands for "processes all users with wide output". 
The "auxw" option is used to display all processes for all users in a wide format, which includes additional columns of information.
